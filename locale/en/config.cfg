throttling=For a value N, divides the per-player search area into (N*2)^2 subdivisions. Reducing the number improves responsiveness, increasing it reduces CPU use.

drone_process_other_player_construction=Allow drones to complete construction tasks from other players
drone_process_other_player_upgrade=Allow drones to complete construction tasks from other players
drone_process_other_player_proxies=Allow drones to complete proxy tasks from other players (Modules, Logistic Requests, etc.)
construction-drone-search-radius=Search radius (in units) to find available tasks.
force-player-position-search=Force the search area to be clamped to the player character, making drones not work remotely unless the task is within the search radius of the player
remote-view-spawn=Allow drones to spawn from the remote view (This will not work across surfaces). WARNING: Drones can sometimes get stuck when pathing back to the player
