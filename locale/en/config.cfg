[mod-setting-description]
throttling=For a value N, divides the per-player search area into (N*2)^2 subdivisions. Reducing the number improves responsiveness, increasing it reduces CPU use.
drone_process_other_player_deconstruction=Allow drones to complete deconstruction tasks from other players
drone_process_other_player_construction=Allow drones to complete construction tasks from other players
drone_process_other_player_upgrade=Allow drones to complete construction tasks from other players
drone_process_other_player_proxies=Allow drones to complete proxy tasks from other players (Modules, Logistic Requests, etc.)
construction-drone-search-radius=Search radius (in units) to find available tasks.
force-player-position-search=Force the search area to be clamped to the player character, making drones not work remotely unless the task is within the search radius of the player
remote-view-spawn=Allow drones to spawn from the remote view (This will not work across surfaces). WARNING: Drones can sometimes get stuck when pathing back to the player
construction-drone-unlimited=Allow unlimited construction drones by default and hide related technologies

[controls]
construction-drone-toggle=Toggle construction drones.

spectral-drones=Upgrade all drones to a "spectral" variant, which can phase through all objects except impassible tiles
construction_drone_unlocked=Unlock Construction Drones, which can be dispatched to build, deconstruct, upgrade, and perform other tasks.\n\nThe default number of drones that can be active per-player at once is 2, which can be increased by researching the "Construction Drone Count" technologies.
